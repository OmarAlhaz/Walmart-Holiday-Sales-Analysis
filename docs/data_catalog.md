## ðŸ”‘ Notes
- Missing values in `Weekly_Sales`, `CPI`, and `Unemployment` were **imputed with the mean**.  
- Only rows with `Weekly_Sales > 10,000` were included in the clean dataset to filter out low/no-sales records.  
- Final analysis focuses on **monthly sales trends** and the **impact of holidays**.

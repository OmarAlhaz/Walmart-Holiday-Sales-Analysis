## 📌 Overview
Walmart is the largest retailer in the United States, with e-commerce sales reaching **$80B in 2022** (13% of total sales).  
One key driver of demand is **public holidays** such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  

This project builds a **data pipeline** in Python to analyze **supply and demand trends around holidays**.  
It covers **data extraction, transformation, aggregation**, and produces insights about sales patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an **ETL pipeline** using **Python & Pandas**.  
- Merge multiple datasets (PostgreSQL export + Parquet complementary data).  
- Clean and transform data into a structured format.  
- Analyze **monthly sales trends** and the **impact of holidays**.  
- Export cleaned and aggregated data as CSVs.

## 🔧 Pipeline Steps

1. **Extract**

   * Load sales (`grocery_sales.csv`) and complementary data (`extra_data.parquet`).
   * Merge on the `index` column.

2. **Transform**

   * Handle missing values (fill with column mean).
   * Convert `Date` → `Month`.
   * Filter out low-sales records (`Weekly_Sales` > 10,000).
   * Keep relevant features.

3. **Aggregate**

   * Group by month.
   * Compute average weekly sales.

4. **Load**

   * Save processed datasets:

     * `clean_data.csv` (filtered, clean dataset)
     * `agg_data.csv` (monthly average sales)

## 📌 Tech Stack

* **Python (pandas, numpy)** → Data manipulation
* **CSV + Parquet** → Data formats
* **PostgreSQL (source table)** → Original grocery sales
* **Modular ETL pipeline** → `extract`, `transform`, `aggregate`, `load`

---

## 🔍 Insights

* Sales spike significantly during **Thanksgiving & Christmas** (up to **40% higher** than early months).
* **Markdown promotions** amplify holiday demand.
* **Store type & size** strongly influence holiday sales performance.
* Economic factors (CPI, unemployment) have **weaker short-term effects** compared to seasonality.
